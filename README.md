FAQ
===
Q: This isn't an official OOlite repo - what are you up to?
A: I want to find out how a game is designed, and whether or not I'm smart enough to have a go at changing or extending it myself.

Q: Can I use what's in here?
A: I guess. As far as I know the source is all freely available. I'm not claiming any rights over this stuff - all IP still belongs to the original authors - check the official website at http://oolite.org/ for more info. The safest option if you do clone from here is to make sure you maintain all the README and other attribution files.

Q: Why did you create this repo?
A: I want to mess about with the OOlite code, and be able to get back to a working state when I inevitably screw it up.
